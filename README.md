# Conventions

- Try to write your components AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE :) and do not hesitate to add additional files if needed. Read small files is more simple. üëç
- Try to **split** your code into components.
- Do not forget about postfixes to distinguish your app building blocks and just to navigate easily.
